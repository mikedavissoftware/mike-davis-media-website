          <p className="heading-sec__sub">
            Ever since I was a kid, I've loved taking devices apart and putting them back together. That early interest in learning how systems work later evolved into assembling my first desktop computer at the age of 13, and subsequently taking four years of CAD-focused mechanical engineering classes throughout high school. I later pursued a mathematics-heavy major in ecological engineering at Colorado State University for two years, until switching to the broader science of restoration ecology. Despite switching my major, the remainder of my undergraduate curriculum was well-supported by what I learned in my engineering courses, and I graduated in 2016 with a BS in Restoration Ecology.

            Throughout my schooling and beyond, I have always been a self-starter, pursuing a diversity of independent ventures in freelancing, nonprofits, and the arts (music, film, and graphic design).

            During my career as a valued member of the Fort Collins music community, I co-founded and served as drummer-producer for the independent prog-punk band <a href="https://linktr.ee/chessatbreakfast" target="_blank">Chess at Breakfast</a>. Despite the local dominance of folk, bluegrass, americana, and guitar-driven jam music, my bandmates and I achieved substantial success in the Fort Collins scene. Over our five-year run (2016-2021), we played over 70 shows, successfully executed 2 regional tours, and self-produced & independently released 3 albums & frequent singles. Building a successful & sustainable independent music business required the development & reinforcent of many skills in music, audio, video, graphic design, event production, logistics, and business management. (See <a href="#skills">My Skills</a> below for a comprehensive list.)

            However, my contributions to the art community expanded beyond music, though often stemming from it. For over a decade, I've facilitated numerous cross-disciplinary projects within my network of collaborators, both locally and remotely. From producing & releasing a song written specifically to a piece of visual art, to heading the conceptualization & production of a dramatic short film, to planning & executing multiple livestreamed fundraising events, I have a strong background in sociotechnical project management.

          <p className="heading-sec__sub">
            In addition to my contributions to the art community, I also co-founded and currently serve as the Director of Media Production for educational 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization <a href="https://theechofilm.com/" target="_blank">The Echo</a>. My experience within this organization has involved many of the same duties & project management as those of running my band, but with different end goals. Guided by the organization's paramount objective of educating the public about animals, I've overseen the production of short-form documentaries, social media content, and most recently a podcast called <a href="http://onewildpodcast.com/" target="_blank">One Wild World</a>.

            Having spent over a decade pursuing a variety of independent ventures, I've cultivated a diverse & exceedingly valuable perspective on sociotechnical project management. This perspective allows me to operate with technical & conceptual confidence in the production of audio, film, visual art, and software solutions. In addition to refined technical skills, my time in creative entrepreneurship has culminated into a unique awareness of how human & digital systems can work together, both efficiently & efficaciously.

            As a further evolution in my technical skill set, I have spent significant time learning computer science, with a strong emphasis on web development. Having already taught myself how to build a basic website from scratch with knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I decided in 2022 to massively upgrade my skills by attending a coding boot camp. Over the winter of 2022-2023, I attended <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>'s Software Engineering Program live in-person on their Denver campus. During this program, my classmates came to know me as someone who is both friendly and knowledgeable, even electing me as <strong>Most Likely to Help Anyone Anytime</strong> with the course material. I facilitated frequent coding walkthroughs, group learning sessions, and provided individual guidance to classmates. This extra engagement provided reinforcement of my own learning, as well as bolstered my ability to communicate software engineering concepts.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p className="heading-sec__sub">
            After earning my software engineering certificate in February of 2023, I immediately sought out freelance work opportunities within my network to reinforce what I had learned. Through my network, I secured my first freelance development contract with a company called Daggett Control Company. From my previous technical work with Daggett Control on things like domains & email system management, it seemed natural for me to use my new skills to develop their new company website. This project was extremely valuable in reinforcing & augmenting what I learned in the program, for both front end & back end web development. Please see <a href="#projects">My Projects</a> below for more details on Daggett Control and my other highlighted projects.

          <p className="heading-sec__sub">
            I continue to nurture my passion for software development, and I look forward to contributing my technical & interpersonal skills to this ever-evolving field!
