        From my early days of dismantling and reassembling things to figure out how they work, I have always had a genuine curiosity about how systems work. This drove me to pursue an engineering curriculum in both high school and college. During my undergrad at Colorado State University, I took four semesters of engineering, before switching majors and finishing out with a Bachelor of Science degree in Restoration Ecology. While earning my degree, a classmate and I pursued a university-recognized independent study called <a href="https://theechofilm.com/" target="_blank">The Echo</a> in 2015, which we would later nurture into an educational 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization. I still serve as The Echo's Director of Media Production, overseeing a variety of contributiones to public education about animals, the latest of which has been our podcast <a href="http://onewildpodcast.com/" target="_blank">One Wild World</a>.

        Beyond my education and work in the nonprofit sector, I have also garnered a diversity of professional experience in my local art community. As co-founder & drummer-producer for progressive rock band <a href="https://linktr.ee/chessatbreakfast" target="_blank">Chess at Breakfast</a>, I was instrumental (pun intended) in the development of a sustainable music business. In addition to my work with the band, I spearheaded numerous cross-disciplinary projects within the broader art community, utilizing my extensive network of collaborators both locally & remotely.

        My pursuits in the arts and the nonprofit sector constantly require me to learn new <a href="#skills">skills</a>, one of which has been web development. I successfully taught myself how to build websites from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as content management systems like Wordpress. To expand upon this knowledge, I decided to attend <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>'s live in-person Full-Stack Software Engineering boot camp over the winter of 2022-2023. After earning my certificate in February of 2023, I immediately picked up freelance web development work to reinforce & advance what I had learned. Please see <a href="#projects">My Projects</a> below for more details on my freelance software development work. As I continue to nurture my passion for software development, I look forward to contributing my technical & interpersonal skills to this ever-evolving field!
