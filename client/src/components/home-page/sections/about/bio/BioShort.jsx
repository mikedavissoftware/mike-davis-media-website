        Since I was young, I have been a systems thinker, which led to an interest in building computers, engineering, & mathematics. I attended Colorado State University for my undergraduate degree in restoration ecology, the first two years being in engineering before I switched majors. Additionally, I have always been a self-starter, pursuing a diversity of independent ventures in freelancing, nonprofits, and the arts (music, film, and graphic design).

        After acquiring my undergraduate degree, I co-founded and served as drummer-producer for the independent prog-punk band <a href="https://linktr.ee/chessatbreakfast" target="_blank">Chess at Breakfast</a>. We achieved substantial success in the Fort Collins music scene, playing over 70 shows, performing 2 regional tours, and self-producing 3 albums. Building a successful & sustainable independent music business required my development of a diverse set of skills in music, audio, video, graphic design, event production, logistics, and business management. (See <a href="#skills">My Skills</a> below for a comprehensive list.)

        For well over a decade, I've initiated & facilitated numerous cross-disciplinary art projects within my network of friends & collaborators, both locally and remotely. From producing & releasing a song written specifically to a piece of visual art, to heading the conceptualization & production of a dramatic short film, to planning & executing multiple livestreamed fundraising events, I have a strong background in sociotechnical project management.

        Additionally, my sociotechnical acumen has been bolstered by co-founding and currently serving as the Director of Media Production for educational 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization <a href="https://theechofilm.com/" target="_blank">The Echo</a>. My experience within this organization has overlapped heavily with my contributions to the art community, but with differing end goals. Guided by the organization's paramount objective of educating the public about animals, I've overseen the production of short-form documentaries, social media content, and most recently a new podcast called <a href="http://onewildpodcast.com/" target="_blank">One Wild World</a>.

        My unique experiences, impressive skill set, and broad perspective allow me to operate with technical & conceptual confidence in the production of audio, film, visual art, and software projects. Also, my time in creative entrepreneurship has culminated into a unique awareness of how human & digital systems can work together efficiently & efficaciously.

        As a further evolution in my technical skill set, I have spent significant time learning computer science, with a strong emphasis on web development. Having already taught myself how to build a basic website from scratch with knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I decided in 2022 to massively upgrade my skills by attending a coding boot camp. Over the winter of 2022-2023, I attended <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>'s Software Engineering Program live in-person on their Denver campus. During this program, my classmates came to know me as someone who is both friendly and knowledgeable, even electing me as <strong>Most Likely to Help Anyone Anytime</strong> with the course material. I facilitated frequent coding walkthroughs, group learning sessions, and provided individual guidance to classmates. This extra engagement provided reinforcement of my own learning, as well as bolstered my ability to communicate software engineering concepts.

        After earning my software engineering certificate in February of 2023, I immediately sought out freelance work opportunities within my network to reinforce what I had learned. Through my network, I secured my first freelance development contract with a company called Daggett Control Company. From my previous technical work with Daggett Control on things like domains & email system management, it seemed natural for me to use my new skills to develop their new company website. This project was extremely valuable in reinforcing & augmenting what I learned in the program, for both front end & back end web development. Please see <a href="#projects">My Projects</a> below for more details on Daggett Control and my other highlighted projects.

      <p className="heading-sec__sub">
        I continue to nurture my passion for software development, and I look forward to contributing my technical & interpersonal skills to this ever-evolving field!
