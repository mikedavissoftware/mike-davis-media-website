        I have always been a systems thinker, with a natural interest in engineering, mathematics, and using & building computers. With a significant academic background in engineering, and other sciences, I am able to apply an engineer's mindset in all of my pursuits, when needed. Outside of academic successes, I have always been a creative & self-motivated, pursuing a diversity of independent ventures in freelancing, nonprofits, arts, and media.

        After acquiring my undergraduate degree in 2016, I co-founded and served as drummer & producer for independent prog-punk band <a href="https://linktr.ee/chessatbreakfast" target="_blank">Chess at Breakfast</a>. From 2016-2021, we achieved an impressive reputation in the Fort Collins music scene, playing over 70 shows, performing 2 regional tours, and self-producing 3 albums. Building a sustainable independent music business required me to develop a diverse set of skills in music performances, audio production, video production, graphic design, event production, logistics, and business management. Outside of my band, I also frequently spearheaded numerous cross-disciplinary art projects within my extensive network of friends & collaborators, both locally and remotely.

        Beyond my contributions to the art community, my sociotechnical acumen has also been bolstered by co-founding and currently serving as the Director of Media Production for educational 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization <a href="https://theechofilm.com/" target="_blank">The Echo</a>. Since starting in 2015, my work experience within this organization has shared many qualities with my work in the art community, but with differing end goals. Guided by the organization's paramount objective of educating the public about animals, I've overseen the production of short-form documentaries, social media content, and most recently a podcast called <a href="http://onewildpodcast.com/" target="_blank">One Wild World</a>.

        Through entrepreneurial pursuits, I taught myself how to build basic websites from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Having proven my abilities in this discipline already, I decided to attend <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>'s in-person Software Engineering program over the winter of 2022-2023. During this program, my classmates came to know me as someone who is both friendly and knowledgeable. I facilitated frequent group learning sessions and provided individual guidance to classmates, which bolstered my ability to communicate software engineering concepts. After earning my software engineering certificate in February of 2023, I immediately picked up freelance web development work to reinforce & advance what I had learned, in both front end & back end contexts. Please see <a href="#projects">My Projects</a> below for more details on Daggett Control and my other highlighted projects.

        My unique background, diverse <a href="#skills">skill set</a>, and broad perspective allow me to operate with technical & conceptual confidence in the production of audio, film, visual art, and software. Also, my time in creative entrepreneurship has culminated into a unique awareness of how human & digital systems can work together efficiently & efficaciously. I continue to nurture my passion for software development, and I look forward to contributing my technical & interpersonal skills to this ever-evolving field!
