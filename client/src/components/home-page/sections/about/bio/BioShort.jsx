        At my core, I am a creative & self-motivated systems-thinker with strong communication skills and a strong academic background in ecology, engineering, & mathematics. With this background, I can bring an engineer's mindset to my independent & collaborative ventures in software, freelancing, nonprofits, arts, and media.

        During my undergrad at Colorado State University, I met my associate Matthew Juneau, with whom I co-founded the educational 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization <a href="https://theechofilm.com/" target="_blank">The Echo</a>. Since starting as a university-recognized independent study in 2015, my work experience within this organization has shared many qualities with my work in the arts and freelancing, but with differing end goals. As Director of Media Producton, my efforts have been guided by the organization's paramount objective of educating the public about animals. With this in mind, I've overseen the production of short-form documentaries, social media content, and most recently a podcast called <a href="http://onewildpodcast.com/" target="_blank">One Wild World</a>.

        Beyond my undergrad and my work in the nonprofit, I also co-founded and served as drummer-producer for independent progressive rock band <a href="https://linktr.ee/chessatbreakfast" target="_blank">Chess at Breakfast</a>. From 2016 to 2021, we achieved an impressive reputation in the Fort Collins music scene, playing over 70 shows, performing 2 regional tours, and self-producing 3 albums. Building a sustainable independent music business required me to develop a diverse set of skills in music performances, audio production, video production, graphic design, event production, logistics, and business management. Outside of my band, I also frequently spearheaded numerous cross-disciplinary art projects within my extensive network of friends & collaborators, both locally and remotely.

        Through my entrepreneurial pursuits, I taught myself how to build basic websites from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To expand upon this knowledge, I decided to attend <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>'s in-person Software Engineering program over the winter of 2022-2023. During the program, my classmates came to know me as someone who is both friendly and knowledgeable. I facilitated frequent group learning sessions and provided individual guidance to classmates, which bolstered my ability to communicate software engineering concepts. After earning my certificate in February of 2023, I immediately picked up freelance web development work to reinforce & advance what I had learned, in both front end & back end contexts. Please see <a href="#projects">My Projects</a> below for more details on my freelance software development work.

        When seeking work, I emphasize my unique background, diverse <a href="#skills">skill set</a>, and broad perspective. These tools allow me to operate with technical & conceptual confidence in the production of software, audio, film, and visual art. In addition to my hard skills, my time in creative entrepreneurship has culminated into an astute awareness of how human & digital systems can work together efficiently & efficaciously. As I continue to nurture my passion for software development, I look forward to contributing my technical & interpersonal skills to this ever-evolving field!
